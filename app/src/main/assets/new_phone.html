    <h4>All you need to do is sync your files to your Private Cloud:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Make sure that Private Cloud is on within SuperSafe on your old device and that your items have a small check mark sign at the bottom right corner. This means that they are synced and ready to be downloaded on your new device.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Install SuperSafe on your new device and log in with the same email address as on your old device. Go to your Private Cloud settings and make sure that your Private Cloud is enabled.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Keep SuperSafe open on your new device with the screen on until you see that all of your pictures are synced.</li></br>
    </ol>

    <h4>While syncing, please keep in mind the following:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Items with a check mark sign at the bottom right are uploaded to your Private Cloud already.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Items with a white circle are not synced yet and are only stored on the device.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Items with a spinning circle are currently being uploaded to your Private Cloud.</li></br>

        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Please make sure that you have an internet connection. If you are not syncing via a WiFi network, please go to your Private Cloud settings and turn off 'WiFi only'.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">Depending on the amount of data stored in your SuperSafe, as well as on the speed of your connection, the upload might take some time and you might need to keep the app open, without locking the screen. Please set your screen to never lock and keep it on for some time in case the items on your old device do not appear to be syncing.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">If your SuperSafe contains more files than your quota, please contact customer support.</li></br>
    </ol>
