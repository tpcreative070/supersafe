    <h4>Here's how you can unlock all your password protected albums:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">The Fake PIN allows you to add a secondary SuperSafe gallery to disguise your real one - you can access Fake PIN using a separate PIN number. This is very helpful and keeps your real SuperSafe even more secure if anyone makes you open your SuperSafe and you have no other way out of the situation.</li></br>
        <li style="color:#424242 ; font-size:16sp">This feature is now included as a part of a premium subscription. To activate Fake PIN, please go to settings and choose "Fake PIN". You'll be able to manage the Fake PIN settings from there.</li></br>
