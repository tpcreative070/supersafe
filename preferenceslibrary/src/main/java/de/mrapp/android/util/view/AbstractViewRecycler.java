 * efficiently implement widgets similar to ListViews, whose children can be scrolled out of the
 * visible screen area and therefore can be recycled.
 *
 * Each view must be associated with a corresponding item of an arbitrary generic type. By
 * implementing the abstract class {@link Adapter}, the views, which should be used to visualize a
 * specific item, can be inflated and adapted in their appearance. The recycler supports to inflate
 * different layouts for individual items by overriding an adapter's <code>getViewType</code>- and
